# Customer Success Playbook

Create CS playbooks with plays for onboarding, adoption, renewal, and expansion.

## When to Use This Skill
- CS leaders building or formalizing playbooks
- PMs working on retention and activation
- Teams scaling customer success operations
- Defining health scoring and risk frameworks

## What You'll Need

**Critical inputs (ask if not provided):**
- Customer segment (SMB, Mid-Market, Enterprise)
- What CS challenges you're trying to solve

**Nice-to-have inputs:**
- Current churn/renewal rates
- Existing CS processes to improve
- Contract/renewal cycle timeline

## Process

### Step 1: Check Your Context
First, read the user's context files:
- `context/product.md` — Key features, activation milestones, current metrics
- `context/personas.md` — User types, their goals, what "success" looks like for them
- `context/company.md` — Team structure, CS resources, business model

**Tell the user what you found.** For example:
> "I found your personas in personas.md: Jordan (PM) and Sam (Creative Director). Your product.md shows 'First project completed' as your activation milestone and 91% monthly retention. I'll design the playbook around getting Jordan to that first project milestone and keeping Sam's team engaged."

### Step 2: Gather Playbook Context
If you don't have enough context, ask:
> "Before I create this CS playbook, I need:
> 1. Who is this playbook for? (SMB, Mid-Market, Enterprise)
> 2. What CS challenges are you trying to solve? (churn, slow onboarding, low expansion)
>
> I can pull activation milestones from product.md and user profiles from personas.md."

### Step 3: Define Customer Journey Stages
Map the stages from sign-up to renewal/expansion:
- Onboarding (Day 0-30)
- Adoption (Day 31-90)
- Value Realization (Day 91+)
- Renewal/Expansion (Contract milestone)

### Step 4: Create Stage-Specific Plays
Each stage needs:
- Goals and success criteria
- Key activities and touchpoints
- Templates and talk tracks
- Risk signals and interventions

### Step 5: Build Health Scoring
Define leading indicators of success and churn risk.

### Step 6: Create Escalation Matrix
When should CS involve product, engineering, exec?

### Renewal Objection Handlers

**"We want to reduce seats"**
Response: "I understand. Can you tell me more about what's driving that? [Listen] Let's look at your usage data to see if there are underutilized seats we can address differently..."

**"We're evaluating alternatives"**
Response: "That makes sense — you should make the best decision for your team. What criteria are most important to you? [Listen] Here's how we compare on those dimensions..."

**"Budget is tight this year"**
Response: "I hear you. Let's talk about the ROI you've seen with us. [Share metrics] Given this value, what would make the investment work for you?"

### Risk Signals
- Champion left company → Exec escalation, new champion identification
- No exec engagement at 90 days out → Escalate to CS leadership
- Competitor mentioned → Battlecard + exec involvement
- Usage decline → Value realization intervention

## Play 4: Expansion Play

## Health Scoring Framework

### Health Score Components

| Factor | Weight | Green | Yellow | Red |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|-----|
| Usage (DAU/MAU) | 30% | >50% | 25-50% | <25% |
| Feature Adoption | 25% | >3 features | 2-3 features | <2 features |
| NPS/CSAT | 20% | >8 | 6-8 | <6 |
| Support Tickets | 15% | <2/mo | 2-5/mo | >5/mo |
| Engagement | 10% | Active champion | Passive | No champion |

### Health Score Thresholds
- **Green (70-100):** Healthy, expansion opportunity
- **Yellow (40-69):** At risk, intervention needed
- **Red (0-39):** High churn risk, escalate immediately

### Intervention Playbook by Health Score

| Score | Action | Owner | Timeline |
|-------|--------|-------|----------|
| Yellow | CSM outreach + check-in call | CSM | Within 48 hours |
| Red | Exec escalation + rescue plan | CS Manager | Same day |
| Red + Champion left | War room + exec-to-exec | CS Director | Same day |

---

## Escalation Matrix

| Situation | Escalate To | Timeline | What They Do |
|-----------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Onboarding stalled | CS Manager | Day 14 | Unblock resources |
| Champion leaving | CS Director | Same day | Exec outreach |
| Churn risk (Red health) | CS Director | Same day | Rescue plan |
| Product bug blocking | Product | Same day | Prioritize fix |
| Security/compliance | Security | Same day | Compliance response |
| Renewal at risk (>$50K) | VP CS | 60 days out | Exec involvement |
| Competitor threat | VP CS + Sales | Same day | Battlecard + strategy |

## Framework Reference
**Customer Success Stages:**
1. Onboarding — First value
2. Adoption — Full utilization
3. Value Realization — ROI proven
4. Renewal — Contract secured
5. Expansion — Growth captured

## Tips for Best Results
1. **Use your context files** — I'll connect milestones to personas and metrics
2. **Customize timelines** — SMB moves faster than Enterprise
3. **Define clear milestones** — "Activated" should mean something specific
4. **Make health scoring objective** — Gut feel doesn't scale
5. **Escalate early** — Red flags need immediate attention
6. **Document everything** — Playbooks only work if followed

## Suggested Updates
After creating the playbook:
- [ ] Update `product.md` with activation milestones and health thresholds
- [ ] Document churn reasons and intervention triggers
- [ ] Share playbook with CS team for feedback
