# Team Health Check

Run structured team health checks using the Spotify Squad Health Check model to surface what's working and what needs attention.

## When to Use This Skill

- Quarterly or monthly team health assessments
- When something feels off but you can't pinpoint why
- After significant changes (reorg, new leadership, big project)
- Before planning cycles to identify team capacity constraints
- Part of regular engineering/product team rituals

## What You'll Get

- Health check summary with overall team health score
- Traffic light ratings (🟢🟡🔴) across 11 indicators
- Trend analysis comparing to previous health checks
- Root cause analysis for red/yellow indicators
- 2-4 prioritized action items with owners

## What You'll Need

**Critical inputs (ask if not provided):**
- Which team you're assessing
- Team feedback on health indicators (ratings + comments)

**Nice-to-have inputs:**
- Previous health check results (for trends)
- Recent context (launches, incidents, team changes)
- Observations from 1:1s

## Process

### Step 1: Check Your Context
I'll start by reading your context files to understand team structure and recent events:
- `context/company.md` — Team structure, recent org changes, company priorities
- `context/product.md` — Recent releases, incidents, current workload

I'll summarize what I found. For example:
> "I found your Engineering team has 25 people (company.md). Recent context: you launched Resource Planning v2 and had a P2 incident last month (product.md). I'll factor these into the health check interpretation."

### Step 2: Gather Health Check Data
If you don't have the team feedback, ask:
> "Before I run this health check, I need:
> 1. Which team? (I found these teams in company.md: [list])
> 2. Team member ratings on health indicators
>
> Do you have previous health check results for trend comparison?"

**Do NOT generate health assessments without actual team feedback. This is about what the team thinks, not assumptions.**

### Step 3: Define Health Indicators
I'll use the Spotify Squad Health Check indicators (or customize for your team):
- Delivering value
- Easy to release
- Learning
- Mission/purpose
- Fun
- Pawns or players (autonomy)
- Health of codebase
- Teamwork
- Speed
- Support (tools, processes)
- Suitable process

### Step 4: Gather Team Input
Have each team member rate each indicator (green/yellow/red or 1-5) and provide optional comments.

### Step 5: Synthesize Results
I'll calculate averages, identify outliers, and group qualitative feedback into themes.

### Step 6: Identify Trends and Root Causes
I'll compare to previous health checks if available, and dig into why indicators are red/yellow.

### Step 7: Generate Action Items
I'll create 2-4 focused improvements with owners and timeline.

## Output Template

I'll generate this health check summary for you:

## Framework Reference

This skill uses the **Spotify Squad Health Check** model, developed by Henrik Kniberg and Spotify's engineering team. The model:

- Uses traffic light colors (green/yellow/red) for quick visualization
- Includes trend arrows to track progress over time
- Focuses on how the team *feels*, not just metrics
- Is designed to spark conversation, not just measure

Key principles:
- **Anonymity matters** — People are more honest when ratings are anonymous
- **Discussion > scores** — The conversation about "why" is more valuable than the ratings
- **Trend > snapshot** — Improvement direction matters more than absolute score
- **Action-oriented** — Every health check should produce 2-4 improvements to try

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Use your context files** — I'll interpret results in light of recent events and priorities
2. **Run consistently** — Monthly or quarterly, same indicators each time
3. **Make it anonymous** — Use a survey tool, not public voting
4. **Timebox the meeting** — 60-90 min max, or energy drops
5. **Focus on trends** — Don't panic about one red indicator; watch patterns
6. **Limit actions to 2-4** — More than that won't get done
7. **Close the loop** — Review previous action items at start of each health check

## Suggested Next Steps

After reviewing this health check summary, you can:
- Save results for trend tracking
- Update `company.md` with team health status if relevant
- Track action items for next health check
