# Customer Voice Reviewer

Review PRDs and specs from a customer perspective using your personas.

## When to Use This Skill
- Reviewing a PRD before stakeholder sign-off
- Checking if a feature aligns with user needs
- Assessing adoption likelihood
- Preparing for Customer Success concerns
- Evaluating support burden and onboarding complexity

## What You'll Need

**Critical inputs (ask if not provided):**
- The document to review (PRD, spec, proposal)

**Nice-to-have inputs:**
- Which personas are most affected by this feature
- Specific user concerns you're worried about

## Process

### Step 1: Check Your Context

First, read the user's context files to ground the review in their actual users:
- `context/personas.md` — **CRITICAL** — Who are the users? What are their needs, pains, and behaviors?
- `context/product.md` — Current user experience, onboarding flow, support pain points
- `context/company.md` — Customer Success team size, support capacity

**Tell the user what you found:**
> "I found 3 personas in personas.md: [Persona 1], [Persona 2], and [Persona 3]. I'll review this feature from each of their perspectives. [Persona 2] seems most affected because [reason from their pain points]."

**If personas.md is missing or thin:**
> "I don't have persona context. I can do a generic user review, but it will be stronger if you add persona details to context/personas.md. Want me to help you create personas first?"

### Step 2: Review the Document

Read the full document from a **customer lens**, not a product/business lens.

**Look for:**
- **User value clarity** — Will users understand what this does for them?
- **Adoption friction** — What makes this hard to adopt?
- **Learning curve** — How long to understand this?
- **Onboarding complexity** — Does this change how new users start?
- **Support burden** — What new questions will Customer Success get?
- **Churn risk vs. retention benefit** — Does this help or hurt retention?

### Step 3: Evaluate Per Persona

For each persona in `personas.md`, assess:

**Persona Perspective:**
- **Will they want this?** (excited / lukewarm / resistant)
- **Will they use it?** (adoption likelihood)
- **Will they understand it?** (clarity and discoverability)
- **Will they struggle?** (friction points)

**Use the persona's:**
- **Jobs to be done** — Does this help them accomplish their goals?
- **Pain points** — Does this address their real pains?
- **Behaviors** — Does this fit how they actually work?
- **Technical comfort** — Is this too complex for their skill level?

### Step 4: Customer Success Assessment

From a CS perspective, evaluate:
- **Support tickets expected** — What new questions will CS field?
- **Documentation needs** — What docs must be created/updated?
- **Training requirements** — Do users need training? Does CS need training?
- **Churn risk** — Could this cause users to leave?
- **Expansion opportunity** — Could this drive upsells or higher tier adoption?

### Step 5: Adoption Barrier Analysis

Identify what prevents users from adopting this:
- **Awareness** — Will users discover this exists?
- **Understanding** — Will they know what it does?
- **Motivation** — Will they care enough to try it?
- **Ability** — Can they figure out how to use it?
- **Triggers** — What prompts them to use it?

(Uses Fogg Behavior Model: B = M × A × T)

### Step 6: Generate Output

Create comprehensive customer review with:
1. Context from personas
2. Per-persona assessment
3. Support burden analysis
4. Adoption barriers
5. Customer Success perspective
6. Recommendations

## Adoption Barriers (Fogg Behavior Model)

### Motivation (Do they want this?)
**Level:** High / Medium / Low

**Why:**
- [Does this solve a real pain?]
- [How urgent is the need?]
- [What's the perceived benefit?]

### Ability (Can they use this?)
**Level:** High / Medium / Low

**Why:**
- [Complexity of the feature]
- [Technical skill required]
- [Time investment needed]

### Triggers (What prompts usage?)
**Triggers in the product:**
- [Trigger 1]: [Where/when user sees this]
- [Trigger 2]: [Prompt or notification]

**Missing triggers:**
- [What's needed to remind users to use this]

**Adoption Equation:**
If Motivation = [High/Med/Low] AND Ability = [High/Med/Low] AND Triggers = [Present/Weak/Missing]
THEN Adoption = [High/Medium/Low]

---

**If yes:**
- **Where in onboarding:** [Step/stage]
- **How it changes things:** [Description]

---

## Framework Reference

**Customer-centric product review**:
- Use real personas, not generic "users"
- Evaluate from their perspective, not product/business lens
- Assess adoption barriers (Motivation × Ability × Triggers)
- Predict support burden before launch
- Consider customer success impact, not just product metrics

This skill uses **Fogg Behavior Model** (B=MAT) and **Jobs-to-be-Done** thinking to ground feedback in actual user needs and behaviors.

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Keep personas.md rich and updated** — The more I know about your users, the more grounded this review will be
2. **Be honest about user behavior** — Don't assume adoption, validate it
3. **Think like CS, not PM** — What questions will they get? What makes their job harder?
4. **Consider onboarding impact** — Every new feature changes the new user experience
5. **Predict support burden** — Better to overstaff CS than be surprised
6. **Use this before launch** — Cheaper to simplify now than fix post-launch
7. **Pair with user research** — This review identifies risks; actual user testing validates them

---

## Calibration

**If you want focus on specific persona:**
> "Review this from [Persona name]'s perspective only."

**If you want CS-heavy review:**
> "Focus on support burden and documentation needs."

**If you want adoption-heavy review:**
> "Focus on adoption barriers and how to drive usage."

**If you have specific concerns:**
> "I'm worried users won't understand [X]. Focus on that."

---

## When NOT to Use This Skill

❌ **Don't use when:**
- You don't have personas yet (create them first)
- Feature is internal-facing only (not customer-facing)
- Low-stakes feature with minimal impact
- You're in early brainstorming (too early for detailed review)

✅ **Use when:**
- Customer-facing feature (directly impacts users)
- High adoption required for success
- Worried about support burden
- Want to prepare CS team for launch
- Need to justify ROI with user value

---

## After This Review

**Next steps:**
1. Address red flags and top concerns
2. Create required documentation
3. Plan CS enablement and training
4. Set up adoption metrics to track
5. Prepare communication plan for launch
6. (Optional) Run actual user testing to validate predictions
