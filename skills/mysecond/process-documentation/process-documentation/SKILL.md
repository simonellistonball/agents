# Process Documentation

Documents team processes with a quick reference checklist and detailed step-by-step guide that new team members can follow.

## When to Use This Skill

- Onboarding new team members who need to learn processes
- Standardizing operations across the team
- Compliance or audit documentation
- Capturing knowledge before someone leaves
- Creating runbooks for recurring tasks

## What You'll Need

**Critical inputs (ask if not provided):**
- Which process to document
- Who performs this process (role)

**Nice-to-have inputs:**
- Current steps (even rough notes)
- Common mistakes or gotchas
- Tools/systems involved
- Who to escalate to when things go wrong

## Process

### Step 1: Check Your Context
First, read the user's context files:
- `context/company.md` — Team structure, roles, escalation paths
- `context/product.md` — Related features, tools used, systems involved

**Tell the user what you found.** For example:
> "I found your team structure in company.md — your CS team has 12 people and Engineering has 25. I'll tailor the process doc to the right audience and include relevant escalation paths."

### Step 2: Gather Process Details
If you don't have enough context, ask:
> "Before I document this process, I need:
> 1. What process are we documenting?
> 2. Who performs it? (I found these roles in company.md: [list])
> 3. When/how often does it happen?
>
> Do you have rough notes or current steps I can build from?"

**Do NOT generate a process doc from imagination. Get the actual steps first.**

### Step 3: Define Scope and Audience
Clarify what process you're documenting, who will use this doc, and what they need to accomplish.

### Step 2: Create Quick Reference Checklist
Build a scannable checklist for experienced users who just need a reminder of the steps.

### Step 3: Document Detailed Steps
Write the full step-by-step guide with screenshots, links, and context that a new person would need.

### Step 4: Identify Roles and Responsibilities
Clarify who does what, who approves, and who to contact for help.

### Step 5: Capture Exceptions and Edge Cases
Document what to do when things don't go as expected.

### Step 6: Add Ownership and Maintenance
Assign an owner and create a changelog to keep the doc fresh.

## Framework Reference

This skill follows documentation best practices from:

- **Write the Docs** community standards for technical documentation
- **The Documentation System** (Divio) — separating quick reference from detailed how-to
- **Runbook patterns** from SRE/DevOps practices

Key principles:
- Lead with a scannable checklist for speed
- Provide enough detail for someone completely new
- Document exceptions because they always happen
- Assign ownership because orphan docs go stale

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Use your context files** — I'll pull team structure and escalation paths from company.md
2. **Walk through the process yourself** — Document while doing, not from memory
3. **Include the "why"** — Context helps people make good decisions when things go sideways
4. **Screenshot liberally** — Show where to click, what success looks like
5. **Test with a new person** — Have someone unfamiliar try to follow the doc
6. **Set a review date** — Stale docs are worse than no docs

## Suggested Updates
After documenting:
- [ ] Link this process doc from relevant product.md sections
- [ ] Notify team members who use this process
- [ ] Set calendar reminder for review date
