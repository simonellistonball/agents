# Board Deck Generator

Create board meeting decks with clear narrative arc, metrics, and Q&A prep.

## When to Use This Skill
- Quarterly board meetings
- Investor updates
- Executive reviews requiring formal presentation
- Annual planning presentations

## The Problem

Board decks are high-stakes but time-consuming. PMs spend days building slides, only to realize they buried the lede, missed key metrics, or failed to prep for tough questions. Bad decks lose board confidence.

**This skill solves it by:** Structuring your deck with a proven 10-slide framework, narrative arc selection (Momentum/Turnaround/Inflection), and Q&A prep—so you present with confidence and keep board trust.

## What You'll Get

I'll generate a complete board deck including:
- 10-slide structure with narrative arc (Momentum, Turnaround, or Inflection)
- Executive summary with TL;DR and asks
- Metrics scorecard with status indicators
- Accomplishments mapped to OKRs
- Product, GTM, team, and financial updates
- Risks and challenges with mitigation
- Q&A prep guide with anticipated questions
- Appendix slides for detail

## What You'll Need

**Critical inputs (ask if not provided):**
- What time period is this covering?
- What's the narrative arc? (Momentum, Turnaround, or Inflection)
- What are your key asks from the board?

**Nice-to-have inputs:**
- Key metrics with current values
- Major accomplishments to highlight
- Specific risks or challenges to address

## Process

### Step 1: Check Your Context
I'll start by reading your context files:
- `context/product.md` — Current metrics, roadmap progress, feature adoption
- `context/company.md` — Strategic priorities, OKRs, team structure, funding stage
- `context/personas.md` — Customer context for "who we serve" narrative
- `context/competitors.md` — Competitive landscape for market positioning

**I'll tell you what I found.** For example:
> "I found your company context: Series B, $25M raised, 85 employees. Your product.md shows ARR at $3.2M with 15% MoM growth. Your Q2 OKRs were 'Expand enterprise' and 'Launch Resource Planning.' I'll structure the deck around progress against these goals and your competitive positioning vs Monday.com."

### Step 2: Gather Board Context
If you haven't provided enough context, I'll ask:
> "Before I create this board deck, I need:
> 1. What period is this covering?
> 2. What's the narrative arc — Momentum (things going well), Turnaround (recovering), or Inflection (decision point)?
> 3. What's your primary ask from the board?
>
> I can pull metrics from product.md and strategic context from company.md."

If metrics are missing, I'll mark sections as `[CEO TO FILL]` rather than inventing data.

### Step 3: Define the Narrative Arc
Every board deck tells a story. I'll help you identify yours:

| Arc Type | When to Use | Structure |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Momentum** | Things are going well | Here's our velocity → here's what's next → here's how you can help |
| **Turnaround** | Recovering from challenges | Here's what happened → here's what we learned → here's the plan |
| **Inflection** | Major decision point | Here's where we are → here are the options → here's our recommendation |

### Step 4: Gather Your Metrics
I'll pull together:
- Financial metrics (ARR, MRR, burn, runway)
- Growth metrics (customers, revenue growth, churn)
- Product metrics (engagement, NPS, key feature adoption)
- Team metrics (headcount, key hires, attrition)

### Step 5: Structure Your Deck
I'll use the 10-slide framework (see template below).

### Step 6: Prepare for Q&A
Board members will ask hard questions. I'll help you anticipate them.

### Step 7: Build Your Appendix
Detailed slides that support the narrative but don't clutter the main deck.

## Output Template

I'll generate this board deck for you:

## Framework Reference
**10-Slide Board Deck Structure:**

## Tips for Best Results
1. **Use your context files** — I'll pull metrics from product.md, strategy from company.md
2. **Lead with the TL;DR** — Busy board members may only read slide 2
3. **Be honest about challenges** — Boards appreciate transparency over spin
4. **Make asks explicit** — Don't bury what you need
5. **Prepare the Q&A** — The questions you fear are the ones to prepare for
6. **Use appendix liberally** — Detail belongs in backup slides
7. **Update your context files after** — New metrics, decisions, asks go back into product.md

## Suggested Updates
After the board meeting:
- [ ] Update `product.md` with new targets or metrics discussed
- [ ] Update `company.md` with any strategic decisions
- [ ] Log board feedback for next quarter's deck
